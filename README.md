(Micro)Python class to access the MFRC522 RFID reader

Basic class to access RFID readers of the type [MFRC522](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/MFRC522.pdf). 
This is basically a re-write of [this](https://github.com/mxgxw/MFRC522-python) Python port for the MFRC522. I 
tried to strip things down and make them more "pythonic" so the result is small enough to run on 
[Micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) boards. I tried the class so far on the 
[ESP8266](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/esp8266), 
the [WiPy](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/cc3200)
and [Pi Pico](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/rp2).

## Usage

Put the modules ``mfrc522.py``, ``examples/read.py``, ``examples/write.py`` to the root of the flash FS on your board. 
For the ESP8266 there are multiple solutions to do that. E.g. use the 
[WebREPL file transfer](https://github.com/micropython/webrepl), or [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell). 
 
I used the following pins for my setup:

| Signal    | GPIO ESP8266 | GPIO WiPy      | GPIO Pi Pico   | Note                                 |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| sck       | 0            | "GP14"         | 18             |                                      |
| mosi      | 2            | "GP16"         | 19             |                                      |
| miso      | 4            | "GP15"         | 16             |                                      |
| rst       | 5            | "GP22"         | 20             |                                      |
| cs        | 14           | "GP17"         | 17             | SDA on most RFID-RC522 boards        |
 
Now enter the REPL you could run one of the two examples: 

For detecting, authenticating and reading from a card:
 
    import read
    read.do_read()
    
This will wait for a MifareClassic 1k card. As soon the card is detected, it is authenticated, and 
16 bytes are read from address 0x08.

For detecting, authenticating and writing to a card:

    import write
    write.do_write()

This will wait for a MifareClassic 1k card. As soon the card is detected, it is authenticated, and 
16 bytes written to address 0x08.
